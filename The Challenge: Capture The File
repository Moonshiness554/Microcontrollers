I have placed 3 files in the computers on the edge of the room.

Your goal is to:

0. ssh into your aite's computer and search for the file (must be in one of 10 directories, may be hidden)

1. grab the file and move it to your secret home folder.

10. use the commands we have discussed so far and others. Tab completion is a must.

11. To win you will either have both your file and your aite's file, or a certain number of points:






tools used
