I have placed 3 files in the computers on the edge of the room.

Your goal is to:

0. ssh into the computer, and find the directory with the folder name (will be broadcast with a wall from myself).

1. grab the file and move it to your secret home folder.

10. use the commands we have discussed so far and others. Tab completion is a must.
